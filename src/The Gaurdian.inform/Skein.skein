If you're unsure of how to do something, or stuck at a particular point, try some of these commands and you may get some hints.&#x000A;&#x000A;The format of this list will be  &lt;Command&gt;: &lt;what the command does&gt;. &#x000A;&lt;object&gt; means replace that with the actual name of the object in the command. &#x000A;&lt;person&gt; means replace that with the name of a person that you meet in the command. etc.&#x000A;-look: will redescribe the room/place you're in and the things in it. &#x000A;-examine (x for short): will take a closer look at an object in the room/place. &#x000A;         eg. examine plates &#x000A;-play &lt;object&gt;: if the object is an instrument, this command allows you to play it. &#x000A;         eg. play guitar &#x000A;-take &lt;object&gt;: if you can take an object and carry it with you, this command will put it in your inventory so that you can keep the object on your person. You can also buy items buy using the take command. As an alternative you can use the buy command. &#x000A;         eg. take stool &#x000A;-buy &lt;object&gt;: this allows you to buy wares from vendors. You can also use the take command. &#x000A;         eg. buy peaches &#x000A;-drop &lt;object&gt;: will remove an object from your inventory and into the room/place you're in. &#x000A;         eg. drop candle &#x000A;-inventory (i for short): will show you all the objects you're currently carrying. &#x000A;-go &lt;direction&gt; (abbreviation for direction, like n for north, or just the direction for short): will take you in that direction to the next room/place The directions are North, East, South West, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest, Up, and Down. There's no need to specify through what you think you're going through, like a hole, just writing the direction is enough! &#x000A;          eg. go down &#x000A;-ask &lt;person&gt; about &lt;object&gt;: If there's a named person, you can ask them about objects you may have learned about. &#x000A;          eg. ask Bob about the eggs &#x000A;-put &lt;object&gt; on &lt;object&gt;: will set the first object on top of the second one. &#x000A;         eg. put cup on the table &#x000A;-pray to &lt;diety&gt;: allows you to sacrifice a gift in order to receive wisdom from a diety in their temple. To pray you must put a gift on the altar first. You can only pray to the diety of that temple, and you can only pray to that diety at the altar. &#x000A;         eg. pray to Venus, or just pray &#x000A;-open &lt;object&gt;: will open any unlocked object that is closed. &#x000A;         eg. open box&#x000A;&gt;</result>

After she is done communicating with us, she returns our gift to us in gratitude, and it won't be a pile of ashes anymore! Your gift will not disappear so remember to take it after you have finished praying. Also, only put one item on the altar, so that Athena knows what advice to give you!&#x000A;&#x000A;Athena has some favorite types of gifts. Each gift tends to garner a different response from our Goddess so if you'd like the full story from her, you should bring many gifts. Here's a list of gifts that we've found to favorable so far (the list may change): Olives, a Tiger Lily&#x000A;&#x000A;You're not really sure where to find those gifts mentioned yet so maybe you can ask somebody in the Agora about these gifts for help.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Are you going crazy and you just can't see Medusa in this room?&#x000A;&#x000A;You start to slowly step away but he yells, "Not so fast Medusa! You won't be able escape me or my blade!"

It seems to be a potion bottle. With that realization, the mountain shakes and a gusts of wind hits you straight in the face! And suddenly you remember everything....&#x000A;&#x000A;You remember your family! You may not have had the most contact with them since you were born a human and they were all immortal, but you can finally remember and at this time you're happy to know them! You remember when you first became a priestess for Athena, and you felt like you had a purpose. You felt like you were helping your fellow people live a safe and moral lifestyle. Your favorite part is that you really felt Athena was also protecting you and guiding you and you miss her so much. And then you remember him. You remember feeling dirty and unpure. You remember try to fight back. You remember losing... You feel yourself changing and you can see Perseus stepping back only slightly in fear. You don't want this. You don't want to be like this. You like talking to people. You like being with people. You want to see the island. You want to see the sky again. If you keep changing you'll never be able to be free again.&#x000A;&#x000A;"Please Athena! You can't take it back! Don't change me forever! Please..." you shout to the ceiling hoping that she'll hear you. "I'm so sorry my child..." Athena whispers in your head, "I wish I were stronger to right the wrong done to you. I want to take it back, but I can't my daughter. But I can try to keep you safe. There are no mirrors in here. Wait you don't have all three shields! You do have the ceremonial knife but you are not as skilled in combat as he is! I cannot interfere with the killing of Perseus! The male Gods will have my head! You have to try and defeat him on your own, but I believe in you my child...please live...."&#x000A;&#x000A;Perseus feels courageous and comes at you swinging. The blade catches your left arm and you scream in pain.  You start to hear constant hissing sound. Your hair feels heavier. You feel stronger, but you still try to flee. You take a stab at him catch his shoulder, but it does nothing to stop him, so you turn to run. Perseus seeing his opportunity comes after you as your back is turned. "You're as good as dead you fucking monster!" his words stinging you like acid and you can't handle it anymore. You try to turn and use your powers against him, but with his bronze shield he doesn't even look at you as he beheads you.&#x000A;&#x000A;With your finally moments of conciousness in pure agony, you see a line of women coming to you. They're all weeping for you. You realize they are the Goddess, and they must be keeping you in this world because you don't know how you're still alive. The Goddesses are absolutely stunning and you've never felt so blessed since you're seeing them all at once. You sense they're here to comfort you and you start to relax into the slow release of blackness. Suddenly you see a familiar face, "Antheia? Is that you?" you say with your last breath. "You can call me Venus my darling," she says choking up, " We've always been here for you and we always will be...."&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** You're were killed and for what?

For us to get our gifts to Athena, we've built a special altar where we can place our gift and it will be burnt after you start to pray so that the smoke will rise up to our Goddess. After she is done communicating with us, she returns our gift to us in gratitude, and it won't be a pile of ashes anymore!&#x000A;&#x000A;We've learned that some of Athena's favorite gifts are Olives, Tiger Lillies, Cinnamon, Dragonis Blood, Onyx, Star Sapphire, and Ivory. Each gift garners a different response from Athena though so it would be a great idea to get multiple gifts for a more complete answer about something.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're not really sure where to find those gifts mentioned yet so maybe you can ask somebody in the Agora about  these gifts for help.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Guidelines to pray to the Goddess Athena:&#x000A;&#x000A;Our goddess requires gifts to give us her devine thoughts. For us to get our gifts to Athena, we've built a special altar where we can place our gift and it will be burnt after you start to pray so that the smoke will rise up to our Goddess. After she is done communicating with us, she returns our gift to us in gratitude, and it won't be a pile of ashes anymore!&#x000A;&#x000A;We've learned that some of Athena's favorite gifts are Olives, Tiger Lillies, Cinnamon, Dragonis Blood, Onyx, Star Sapphire, and Ivory. Each gift garners a different response from Athena though so it would be a great idea to get multiple gifts for a more complete answer about something.&#x000A;&#x000A;You're not really sure where to find those gifts mentioned yet so maybe you can ask somebody in the Agora about  these gifts for help.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>
